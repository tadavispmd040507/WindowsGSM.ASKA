## Steam Game Server Account Management

ASKA requires a **Login Token**, to get this head over to [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/managegameservers) and create one using **1898300** as the App ID, then copy and paste the generated **Login Token** to the **Server GSLT** in the **Edit Config** in WindowsGSM and save it. The plugin will write it to the **server properties.txt.**

## Server Ports
When you set the Server Ports in the **Edit Config** it will set them in the **server properties.txt** on the **FIRST** launch only, if you change them after that you will need to edit them in the **server properties.txt**

## Key Notes

This game is in **Early Access**, WindowsGSM and this plugin is not responsible for any lost data that could occure to your server.
